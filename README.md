# Bob Content Generation

Bob Content Generation is a simple command-line tool for generating text content using a Markov chain-based approach. It takes a text corpus as input and produces generated content based on the patterns observed in the corpus.

cd bob-content-generation


3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to generate content with Bob.

python main.py --corpus <corpus_file_path> --length <content_length>


Arguments:
- `--corpus`, `-c`: Path to the text corpus file.
- `--length`, `-l`: Length of the generated content (default: 100).
